# Multi-User Quick Match Testing Guide

## üöÄ Testing the Enhanced Quick Match System with Multiple Users

The system is now enhanced with comprehensive debugging and proper multi-user support. Here's how to test it thoroughly:

### **1. Start Both Servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend WebSocket Server
cd backend
node simple-server.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend React App
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **2. Multi-User Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario A: Basic Multi-User Testing (3 Users)**
1. **Open 3 browser windows** with different emails:
   - Window 1: `user1@test.com` / `password`
   - Window 2: `user2@test.com` / `password`
   - Window 3: `user3@test.com` / `password`

2. **Set all users to Available** in each window

3. **Start Quick Match** in Window 1

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - User 1 finds User 2 or User 3
   - If User 2 declines ‚Üí System finds User 3
   - If User 3 accepts ‚Üí Session starts

#### **Scenario B: Multiple Declines Test (4 Users)**
1. **Open 4 browser windows:**
   - Window 1: `requester@test.com` (will start quick match)
   - Window 2: `decliner1@test.com` (will decline)
   - Window 3: `decliner2@test.com` (will decline)
   - Window 4: `accepter@test.com` (will accept)

2. **Set all users to Available**

3. **Start Quick Match** in Window 1

4. **Have Users 2 and 3 decline** when they receive invitations

5. **Expected Behavior:**
   - User 4 should receive the invitation
   - User 4 accepts ‚Üí Session starts
   - Console shows declined users being tracked

#### **Scenario C: Reconnection Test**
1. **Start with 3 users** as in Scenario A
2. **Have one user decline** the invitation
3. **Close the browser window** of the user who declined
4. **Reopen the browser** and login with the same email
5. **Expected Behavior:**
   - User should not receive another invitation from the same requester
   - System should find a different user

### **3. Debugging and Monitoring**

#### **Backend Console Output**
Watch the backend console for detailed logging:
```
=== Finding compatible users for user-requester@test.com ===
Declined users: ['user-decliner1@test.com']
Total available users: 3
All available users: ['user-decliner1@test.com', 'user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
Compatible users after filtering: ['user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
=== End search ===

=== SYSTEM STATE DEBUG ===
Connected users: ['user-requester@test.com', 'user-decliner1@test.com', 'user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
Available users: ['user-decliner1@test.com', 'user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
Declined users map:
  user-requester@test.com: ['user-decliner1@test.com']
=== END DEBUG ===
```

#### **Debug API Endpoint**
Check system state via API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/debug
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "connectedUsers": ["user1@test.com", "user2@test.com", "user3@test.com"],
  "availableUsers": ["user2@test.com", "user3@test.com"],
  "declinedUsers": {
    "user1@test.com": ["user2@test.com"]
  },
  "totalUsers": 3,
  "totalSessions": 3
}
```

### **4. Expected Behaviors**

#### **‚úÖ Correct Behaviors:**
- **Each user only receives one invitation** per quick match request
- **System moves to new users** after each decline
- **Declined users are tracked** and never asked again
- **Reconnections preserve** declined user lists
- **Clear console logging** shows the process
- **System state is consistent** across all operations

#### **‚ùå What Should NOT Happen:**
- Same user receiving multiple invitations
- System asking declined users again
- Lost tracking after reconnections
- Inconsistent user state

### **5. Testing Checklist**

#### **Basic Functionality:**
- [ ] Multiple users can connect simultaneously
- [ ] Quick match finds available users
- [ ] Invitations are sent to different users
- [ ] Declined users are tracked
- [ ] System moves to new users after declines
- [ ] Sessions start when users accept

#### **Advanced Functionality:**
- [ ] Reconnections preserve user state
- [ ] Declined users list persists across reconnections
- [ ] System handles user disconnections gracefully
- [ ] Debug logging shows correct information
- [ ] API endpoints return accurate data

#### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] All users decline ‚Üí System stops gracefully
- [ ] Users disconnect during matching ‚Üí System adapts
- [ ] Multiple quick matches simultaneously ‚Üí No conflicts
- [ ] User reconnects with same email ‚Üí State preserved

### **6. Troubleshooting**

#### **If Users Receive Multiple Invitations:**
1. Check console logs for declined user tracking
2. Verify user IDs are consistent
3. Check if users are reconnecting with different IDs

#### **If System Doesn't Move to New Users:**
1. Check if declined users list is being populated
2. Verify `findCompatibleUsers` function is filtering correctly
3. Check if users are actually available

#### **If Reconnections Don't Work:**
1. Verify user IDs are based on email (stable)
2. Check if user state is being preserved
3. Ensure declined users list isn't being cleared

### **7. Performance Testing**

#### **Load Testing:**
- Test with 5-10 simultaneous users
- Verify system handles multiple quick matches
- Check memory usage and performance

#### **Stress Testing:**
- Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- Multiple declines in quick succession
- Simultaneous quick match requests

### **8. Success Criteria**

The system is working correctly if:
- ‚úÖ **No user receives multiple invitations** from the same requester
- ‚úÖ **System always finds new users** after declines
- ‚úÖ **Declined users are properly tracked** and excluded
- ‚úÖ **Reconnections preserve** all user state
- ‚úÖ **Console logging is clear** and accurate
- ‚úÖ **API endpoints return** correct system state

## üéØ **Expected Test Results**

### **Scenario A (3 Users):**
1. User 1 starts quick match
2. User 2 receives invitation ‚Üí Declines
3. User 3 receives invitation ‚Üí Accepts
4. Session starts between User 1 and User 3

### **Scenario B (4 Users):**
1. User 1 starts quick match
2. User 2 receives invitation ‚Üí Declines
3. User 3 receives invitation ‚Üí Declines
4. User 4 receives invitation ‚Üí Accepts
5. Session starts between User 1 and User 4

### **Console Output Should Show:**
```
Invitation 1234567890 declined by user-decliner1@test.com. Added to declined list for user-requester@test.com
Current declined users for user-requester@test.com: ['user-decliner1@test.com']
=== SYSTEM STATE DEBUG ===
Connected users: ['user-requester@test.com', 'user-decliner1@test.com', 'user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
Available users: ['user-decliner1@test.com', 'user-decliner2@test.com', 'user-accepter@test.com']
Declined users map:
  user-requester@test.com: ['user-decliner1@test.com']
=== END DEBUG ===
```
